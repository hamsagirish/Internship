Fraudulent insurance claims present significant financial and operational challenges to the insurance industry, necessitating advanced data-driven fraud detection strategies. This study focuses on detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims by leveraging Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We analyze a comprehensive dataset containing policyholder details, incident characteristics, claim amounts, and fraud indicators to identify suspicious claims.
To enhance fraud detection accuracy, we employ four machine learning algorithms—Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)—and compare their performance using key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, extensive feature engineering is conducted to extract meaningful insights from claim data, incorporating factors such as incident severity, vehicle age, policy coverage, and claim history.
Beyond predictive modeling, we develop interactive Power BI dashboards to provide real-time visualization of fraud trends. These dashboards offer deep insights into fraud distribution by state, incident type, policy details, and claim amounts, helping insurance investigators and business analysts efficiently assess and mitigate fraud risks.
The results of this study highlight the effectiveness of machine learning in fraud detection, with XGBoost demonstrating the highest accuracy and recall in identifying fraudulent claims. Our findings contribute to the development of robust fraud detection frameworks, enabling insurance companies to enhance their fraud prevention strategies, reduce financial losses, and optimize claim assessment workflows.
